    "text": "Ad Network\n\n\n\nProgrammatic Advertising Ad Networks\n\n\nAs a first step, an Ad Network was introduced to serve as a broker between a group of advertisers and publishers. Ad Networks, were introduced to help publishers sell their inventory and for advertisers to scale their digital Ad campaigns across many sites without having to deal with each publisher directly. Ad Networks aggregate unsold inventory from several publishers and offers this to the advertisers on a CPM (Cost Per Million) basis.\nBesides reducing the friction inherent in an advertiser - publisher transaction, an Ad network also enhanced the trust in the system. A trursted Ad network like Google, could server as a guarantor for the quality of a publisher’s Ad space inventory while at the same time safeguarding the advertiser’s interest by reducing Ad fraud. As an example, an Ad network ensured that an advertiser was charged only when their Ads were shown on the publishers property.\nThe success of the Ad Network model, attracted many players (like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Seismic etc…) each introducing their own Ad Network. An Ad Network (like Google Display Network or GDN) is a collection of publishers who chose to partner with that particular Ad Network, allowing it to display Ads on their property.\nAs the number of Ad Networks grew, the original problem faced by the advertisers returned. Instead of dealing with multiple publishers, they now had to deal with multiple Ad Networks. An Ad Exhchange was introduced next to solve this problem."

    "text": "Ad Exchange\n\n\n\nProgrammatic Advertising Ad Exchange\n\n\nThe Ad Exchange did to the Ad Networks, what the Ad Network did to the publishers. The Ad Exchange clubbed multiple Ad Networks together and allowed the advertisers to run their campaign across all publishers attached to all Ad Networks attached to the Ad Echange. Further they also allowed marquee publishers to directly sell their Ad space inventory on the exchange, bypassing the Ad Network. These publishers connect to the Ad exchange via an Ad Tech ecosystem component called the Supply Side Platform (SSP).\nSimilarly, on the demand side, the advertisers connect to the Ad exchange via yet another AdTech ecosystem component called the Demand Side Platform (DSP). The DSPs interoperate across multiple Ad exchanges and solves the advertisers problem of dealing with multiple parties. An advertiser therefore selects a DSP based on the flexibility and controls it offers to run an Ad campaign."

DSP is a key component of the real-time bidding process, which allows advertisers to buy Ad space on an impression by impression basis. To help improve targeting, DSPs often use data from Data Management Platform (DMP). DSPs can also buy Ad space by directly connecting to a SSP\nAt this stage the, the phrase programmatic advertising started becoming mainstream. The entire process of buying and selling Ad space was automated. The AdTech ecosystem however continued to evolve to improve the efficacy of the Ad campaign.\n\n\n\nProgrammatic Advertising"
